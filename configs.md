To configure a Cisco ASA 5510 with default settings to allow internet access while separating the outside and inside networks with basic NAT and DHCP, follow these steps:

**Important Note**: Before proceeding, ensure that you have console access to the Cisco ASA 5510 through a console cable and terminal emulation software like PuTTY or a similar tool.

1. **Connect to the Cisco ASA 5510**:
   - Connect one end of the console cable to the console port on the ASA 5510.
   - Connect the other end of the cable to your computer's serial port or USB-to-Serial adapter.

2. **Open Terminal Emulation Software (e.g., PuTTY)**:
   - Launch your terminal emulation software (e.g., PuTTY) and configure it to use the correct COM port associated with your console cable.

3. **Power on the ASA 5510**:
   - Plug in the power cable to the ASA 5510 to power it on.

4. **Access the ASA CLI**:
   - Once the ASA boots up, you should see a console prompt. Press Enter to access the Command-Line Interface (CLI).

5. **Enter Configuration Mode**:
   - Enter privileged EXEC mode by typing:

   ```shell
   enable
   ```

   - Enter global configuration mode:

   ```shell
   configure terminal
   ```

6. **Set Hostname** (Optional):
   - You can set a hostname for the ASA if desired:

   ```shell
   hostname ASA5510
   ```

   Replace "ASA5510" with your desired hostname.

7. **Configure Interfaces**:
   - Define the outside and inside interfaces. Replace "outside" and "inside" with your desired interface names:

   ```shell
   interface GigabitEthernet0/0
   nameif outside
   security-level 0
   ip address dhcp setroute
   no shutdown

   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
   nameif inside
   security-level 100
   ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
   no shutdown
   ```

   - The above configuration assumes that GigabitEthernet0/0 is the outside interface and GigabitEthernet0/1 is the inside interface. Adjust the IP address and subnet mask for the inside interface as needed.

8. **Configure DHCP for Inside Network**:
   - Configure the ASA to provide DHCP to devices on the inside network:

   ```shell
   dhcpd address 192.168.1.2-192.168.1.254 inside
   dhcpd enable inside
   ```

   - This configuration assigns IP addresses in the range of 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.254 to devices connected to the inside interface.

9. **Configure NAT**:
   - Configure basic NAT to allow inside devices to access the internet:

   ```shell
   object network obj_any
   subnet 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
   nat (inside,outside) dynamic interface
   ```

10. **Allow Traffic from Inside to Outside**:
    - By default, the ASA allows traffic from a higher-security-level interface (inside) to a lower-security-level interface (outside). No additional configuration is needed for basic internet access.

11. **Save Configuration**:
    - Save your configuration to memory:

    ```shell
    write memory
    ```

12. **Test Connectivity**:
    - Connect a device to the inside interface and verify that it receives an IP address via DHCP. Test internet connectivity from this device.

Your Cisco ASA 5510 should now be configured to provide basic NAT and DHCP services, allowing devices on the inside network to access the internet through the outside interface. Please note that this is a basic configuration, and you should further secure and tailor the firewall rules and settings to meet your specific network requirements.
